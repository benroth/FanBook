This program takes a URL several online story archives then compiles the story info and all the story chapters into a single, well-formated HTML document. This is useful for achival purposes in case of those stories being pulled off the site or the site going down, but also useful if the user wants to have stories available when they do not have internet access.

To use, simply paste a story URL into the story URL field in the program and hit get info. FanBook will grab the story info, then if you want to download, click the download button. The story will be downloaded and compiled and a table of contents added at the top for ease of reading.

Supported story archives:
--FanFiction.net
--FictionPress.com
--TTHFanfic.org (Twisting the Hellmouth)
--fanficauthors.net

Plans for future: 
--Add additional online archives.
--Add ability to save as various eBook formats (epub, mobi, etc.)
--Add ability to email FanBook directly to Kindle (and whatever other ebook readers have this service.)
--Add ability to add stories to a database to track them for updates, download those updates, and make them easily available for reading. 
--Connected to above, automatically email updates to Kindle, etc..
